👋 Hi. I’m Joe Guest. 

🌊 🦐 I'm a PhD Candidate interested in modelling ecosystems and their related fluxes, the phenology of the global ocean and ecosystem shifts under climate projections. 🐚 🐙

🌎 I'm currently working under Professor Corinne Le Quéré, in her GreenOcean research group at the University of East Anglia.
